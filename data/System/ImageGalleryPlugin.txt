%TOC%

---++ Description
This plugin helps you in viewing pictures that are attached to a topic in a nice thumbnail 
gallery. Clicking on a thumbnail zooms the image. You might navigate within your images using
a navigation toolbar to visit the next, previous, first or last image in your gallery.
Images and thumbnails are resized according to the given settings and are cached thereafter.
The order of images can be customized by putting a sequence number into the attachment comment.
An image attachment can be managed by clicking on the red dot in its title.
The plugin will generate the document relations "parent", "first", "last", "next", "previous"
for each image to improve navigation (only a few browsers support this, e.g. mozilla).
The image gallery is highly customizable using cascading stylesheets and html formats (see
below).

---++ Example
%IMAGEGALLERY{size="large" exclude="logo"}%

---++ Syntax
=%<nop>IMAGEGALLERY{...}%=

| *Argument* | *Description* | *Default* |
| topic | comma separated list of topics whose attachments should be displayed | current topic |
| class | add an additional css class attribute to the image gallery wrapper | =igp= + class depending on the =frontend= and =layout= being used |
| exclude | regular expression an image must _not_ match to be part of the gallery | |
| field | specify which property of the image has to match using =include= or =exclude=; possible values: name, comment (default: name) |
| footer | footer part of the gallery | =/lt;/div>= |
| format | format of an image | %<nop>IMAGE{"$name" topic="$web.$topic" align="left" size="$size" crop="$crop" caption="$title" tooltip="$tooltip" filter="$filter"}%= |
| frontend | select gallery interface, possible values are =default=, =slimbox=, =prettyphoto=, =photoswipe= | photoswipe, prettyphoto or slimbox (in the given prioirty) |
| header | header part of the gallery | =&lt;div class="$class clearfix" data-item-selector=".imageSimple"&gt;= |
| include | regular expression an image must match to be part of the gallery | |
| showhidden | boolean flag to include images that are hidden; set to off to hide hidden images | on |
| layout | thumbnail layout algorithm, can be either =packery= (using Foswiki:Extensions/JQPackeryContrib) or =masonry= or undefined | |
| limit | maximum number of images to display | 0, meaning no limit | 
| reverse | invert the initial order of the images, can be on or off | off |

| titles | toggles image and thumnail titles on and off | off |
| warn | toogles display of error messages, i.e. when no image was found | on |

---+++ Frontends

The =frontend= parameter specifies which user interface to use to display the lightbox in the browser:

   * =default=: use the best user interface given other extensions installed; it checks for [[Foswiki:Extensions/JQPhotoSwipeContrib][photoswipe]], [[Foswiki:Extensions/JQPrettyPhotoContrib][prettyphoto]], and [[%SYSTEMWEB%.JQuerySlimbox][slimbox]] in the given order and uses the first available on the system
   * =photoswipe=: you need to install [[Foswiki:Extensions/JQPhotoSwipeContrib][JQPhotoSwipeContrib]] to use this interface
   * =prettyphoto=: you need to install [[Foswiki:Extensions/JQPrettyPhotoContrib][JQPrettyPhotoContrib]] to use this interface
   * =slimbox=: this is a default lightbox interface shipped with Foswiki

Without any =frontend= or =format= parameter specified will the system use the best interface available.

---+++ Format variables

| *Variable* | *Description* |
| $web | the web the image is located |
| $topic | the topic the image is located |
| $nrimages | the total number of images in the gallery |
| $n | a linefeed |
| $width | the display width of the image |
| $height | the display height of the image |
| $thumbwidth | the thumbnail width of the image |
| $thumbheight | the thumbnail height of the image |
| $origwidth | the original width of the image |
| $origheight | the original height of the image |
| $size | the size of the image |
| $sizeK | the size of the image in kilobytes |
| $comment | the comment of the image (with its sequence number stripped off) |
| $imgnr | the sequence number of the image |
| $date | the date when the image has been uploaded |
| $version | the version of the image attachment | 
| $name | the filename of the image |
| $wikiusername | the wikiusername who uploaded the image |
| $username | the username who uploaded the image |
| $imageurl | the url path of the display image |
| $thumburl | the url path of the thumbnail image |
| $origurl | the url path pointing to the original image attachment |

---+++ Query Parameters
The IGP will check for certain query parameters in the url. These are:
   * id=&lt;n;&gt;: distinguish multiple IMAGEGALLERYs in the same topic
   * filename=&lt;name&gt;: display the given file of the image set
   * refresh=on: recompute all images and thumbnails in the IGP cache
Each IMAGEGALLERY has an anchor, namely a &lt;a name="igp&lt;n&gt;"/&gt;, that
is used to scroll the display appropriately.

---+++ Adjusting the image sequence

By default the image gallery will display images in the order that they where uploaded.
This determines their _natural_ order. When you want to change this order you can
prefix the comment of the attachment with a sequence number. For example: given a
picture whose comment is "My old bike" that should be put at position 12
in your image gallery then change the comment to "12 <nop>- My old bike". This
will put the image at the desired position. Sequence numbers don't necessarily need
to be unique, that is if there's another picture with a comment like 
"12 <nop>- My new bike" then the natural order of the both is relevant. In general,
a picture will be put at position =&lt;nr&gt;= if its attachment comment has the format

<verbatim>
  <nr><space>-<space><comment>
</verbatim>

Note, that the $comment variable will only display =&lt;comment&gt;= , that is with 
=&lt;nr&gt;&lt;space&gt;-&lt;space&gt;= stripped off.
